DCMP is a custom firmware for the Robobuilder humanoid robot. its loaded onto the RBC unit using the RBC upload tool. See manual for instructions. The firmware puts the robot into "Direct Control mode" where command to the serial port are transferred to the bus the servo are connected to. Any responses from the servos are transfered back to the PC.

= Introduction =

DCP provide direct access to wck BUS to enable Servo to be controlled via serial port. In  order to access additional a capabilities a read servo position for servo ID 30 with the following data parameter will return a two byte data response, contain the information requested:


= Details =
||cmd||values||Description||
||1||Get X & Z || Reads the accelerometer 1st Byte X value 2nd Byte the Z value ||
||2||Get Y & Z ||Reads the accelerometer 1st Byte Y value 2nd Byte the Z value ||
||3||PSD on ||Set the Proximity Sensor Device on - for distance measuring ||
||4||PSD off ||Sets PSD off - i.e. powers down - takes at least 50ms to turn back on||
||5||Get PSD ||Reads the current value of the PSD returned 1st byte 10-50 cm||
||6||Get Voltage ||Gets the voltage - in mV - High byte / low byte||
||7||Read IR ||Gets the current value of IR remote in 1st byte - 255 if nothing pressed||
||8||sampling on ||turns sound sampling on - activates 3 bar meter on RBC unit||
||9||sampling off ||sampling off||
||10||Read sound ||Returns the current sound buffer - 2 bytes, average of last 8 samples (4ms each)||
||11||Read timer ||gets the current up time of robot in second:minutes||
||12||Get MIC level ||Sample mic level 50 times and returns average||
||65 - 90||Play Sound: ||Plays built in sound i.e. 65 = sound1, 66 sound 2 etc ||
