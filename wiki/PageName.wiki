Help
L left
R right
F forward
B back
z tilt on/off - to try the autobalance hit z (and turn it off z again!) - don't do near edge of table - suggest have 'r' in off mode as well in case you trigger a behaviour
i ADC test (PSD, Mic, Bat Level) - good for test and debugging
t Tilt test (loop showing accelerometer values until IR pressed
p Basic pose - set him upright
w lean fwd
s lean back
a lean left [not implemented yet]
d lean right [not implmented yet]
v version number (say 0.5)
m modify param [n][+|-|=] [nn]
r respond to event on/off - Robo will start behaving (or is that misbehaving !) - try a clap or push your hand in its face and see what happens !
l light flash test (this doesn't work - anyone tell me why??
nn action nn (two digits) - try 17 for a wave (18 motions built in including soccer kicks (10,11) and side step (12,13)
