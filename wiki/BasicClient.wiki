#summary Windows Basic Client -  A front-end editor, comipler and download for Basic firmware

= Introduction =

A windows based editor and compiler to simplify working with Robobuilder Basic programs. The Basic firmware can work directly with all that is needed being a terminal program, however the client does make transferring programs from PC to Basic much simpler, and enables storage of programs and increase readability of programs.

The upper window is a standard text editor. Note it auto-generates line number and allows the use of labels (unlike the firmware version). 

The bottom windows shows the output of a compile. This can be transfered to the robot by connecting  via a serial link - use the red button (edit COM5 to be the port you use). 

The windows is then an interactive console on to the robot. Press z (to put robot in download mode) and then select download from the menu. The program will automatically compile if not already been performed.

== Key advantages of client ==

  * enable programs to be stored on PC
  * download  and transferred to basic firmware on robot 
  * auto generates line numbers (int increments of 5)
  * allows comments to be added (using ' )
  * allows labels
  * provides context sensitive colour coding
  * allows multi-line if/then/else/endif statements
  * allows const definition
  * Simple functions and procedures
  * Create image filter maps
  * Load binary files and reverse compile
  * basic VT100 terminal with com port selection
  * will check firmware version running on robot

== examples programs ==

Here's an example using example : accelm.rbas

== working with RBasic.exe ==

When a program is compiled a file bindata.txt is created - and this file can then be loaded into basic.exe using 'z' option. It will also be automatically loaded into basic when it starts.
