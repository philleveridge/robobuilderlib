#summary Windows Basic Client (0.1) -  A front end editor and download for Basic firmware

= Introduction =

A windows based edit and compiler to simplify working with basic programs. It is not necessary to use it as all that is required is a terminal program, however it does make transferring programs from PC to robot much simpler.

The upper window is a standard text editor. Note it auto-generates line number and allows the use of labels (unlike the firmware version). 

The bottom windows shows the output of a compile. This can be transfered to the robot by connecting  via a serial link - use the red button (edit COM5 to be the port you use). 

The windows is then an interactive console on to the robot. Press z (to put robot in download mode) and then select download from the menu.
