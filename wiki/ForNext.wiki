#summary The FOR/NEXT loop

= Introduction =

Details on FOR next and how to use

== The FOR/NEXT loop ==

==Form 1==
Coming soon - optional BY parameter, current default is '1' but by can be any number positive or negative.

{{{
FOR x = A TO B [ BY  C ]
....
NEXT x

FOR x = 1 TO 5
....
NEXT x
}}}

==Form 2==
Coming soon - iterate through a list
{{{
FOR x = A IN @B 
''''
NEXT x
}}}

== Details ==
Allows control of looping a set number of times. Updates variable on each pass. FOR/next can be nested - one for loop inside another. Depth 3 max 

===ok not nested ===
{{{
For A=1 to 5
   print a,b
next a
for b=1 to 5
   print a,b
next b
}}}

===ok 2 deep nest ===
{{{
For A=1 to 5
   for b=1 to 5
      print a,b
   next b
next a
}}}

===Wrong overlapping ===
{{{
For A=1 to 5
  for b=1 to 5
    print a,b
   next a
next b
}}}

== more examples ==
BY doesn't have to be only and doesn't have to match exactly
{{{
10 FOR I = 10 TO 3 BY -2
20 PRINT I
30 NEXT I
}}}

I is set to value of the list not an index so 6 then 3 then 1
{{{
410 FOR I = 1 in @{3,6,3,1}
420 PRINT I
430 NEXT I
}}}

This won't print as 7 > 5
{{{
610 FOR i = 7 to 5
620 PRINT i
630 NEXT i
}}}
