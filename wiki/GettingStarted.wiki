#summary Getting Started

= Getting started =

  * Download firmware and manual
  * Restart robot with terminal connected
  * [CommandMode Start in Command mode]
  * [InputMode Input] your program
  * Look through examples

= Details =

== Get and download firmware ==
Download latest firmware (Basic.hex) and upload on to the Robots RBC module using the  RBCUpgrade tool as per Robobuilder [http://robosavvy.com/RoboSavvyPages/Robobuilder/UsersManual/Robobuilder_User_Guide_EN.pdf manual pg 70].

If you're not using Windows, you can still download the custom firmware into your bot using the [ http://www.strout.net/info/robotics/utilities/avrbl-downloader/AVRBL Downloader/]. Or there's a Java based tool available in the source tree.

If you want just to try it out (and not load on to Robot) then there are  windows and Linux OS builds is available  (basic.exe). It input/outputs using console. Some Robot hardware functions are available if the robot is running DCMP firmware connected om serial port.

== Connect terminal ==

So assuming you have downloaded the program (and installed the firmware) - reset the power on the RBC and connect a [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html VT100 terminal emulator] on the serial port (i.e. COM1 at 115200). You should see the following:
{{{
Basic v=$Revision: 629 $
Commands: i r l c z q s V R F $

16 servos connected
0 lines in memory
}}}

== Now in command mode ==

You start in [CommandMode Command Mode]. Now to enter program you type 'i' to get into [InputMode input mode] and then return to command mode to run. If the program ever gets into a recurring loop (either accidentally or deliberately) then press 'Esc' on the PC keyboard. If that fails then hit the 'OFF' button (on the robot!)

To enter a simple "Hello world" program - type following:
{{{
: i
Enter Program '.' to Finish
> 10 PRINT "Hello world"
> 

1 lines entered, [25/3072] Bytes
}}}
To list the program type 'l':
{{{
: l
List Program 
10 PRINT "Hello world"
}}}

And run the program:
{{{
: r
Run Program 
Hello world
End
Elapsed Time 00:00-000
: 
}}}
You can now enter more lines by going back into [#InputMode input mode]. If you want to start over then press 'c.  
my first program

== First program ==

Writing first _real_ program, one that controls the robot. Lets get to robot to stand up.
{{{
10 STAND
}}}

Try and run this. Now make it wave by going into input mode and adding
{{{
20 WAIT KEY
30 RUN 17
}}}

You can run this, it will stand, wait for a key and then wave. Lets add a loop with a wait for key press
{{{
40 GOTO 20
}}}

Now run this. You can also run the program by pressing square/Red button on the controller. To exit press Esc.
