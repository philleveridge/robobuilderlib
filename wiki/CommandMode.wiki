#summary Command Mode options

= Introduction =

When you fist power on the robot with basic firmware loaded it starts in Command mode after first displaying an initial introductory greeting.

{{{
Basic v=$Revision: 629 $
Commands: i r l c z q s V R F $
16 servos connected
4 lines in memory
: 
}}}

This shows the current version number, how many servos it can detect and how many lines are stored in memory.

Command mode signified by ':'. Press a key or use Remote control (for some options)  and select one of the following options:

== Detail ==

|| *Type* || *Description* ||
||r|| Run program - also press Square on Remcon||
||R ||Run program Single step mode - will run one line at a time ||
||g||Run from (Goto) line number||
||G||As G but in single step mode||
||i||[InputMode Input  mode]||
||I||Input mode but show time for each command to run||
||l||List program||
||L||List program and show variable values and list contents||
||V||Show Version||
||c||Clear program||
||q||query servo status||
||Q||[#Q_command Query] and show values||
||X||[#X_charge_mode Enter Battery Charge mode]||
||M||[#M_-_DCMP_mode Enter DCMP mode] (for remote serial control)||
||p||set all servos passive (i.e. free rotate)||
||s||robot to take stand position||
||$ ||[#$_-_Demo_mode Enter Demo mode] (also can use `*B` on remcon) - press Square to exit||
||d||[#dump_memory dump eprom] - D for widemode||
||F||[#dump_memory dump firmware]||
||B||Coming soon - Set breakpoint||
||Y||Coming soon - customise the "stand" position ||
||y||Coming soon - Reset stand to default]||

For more details and programming guide see the PDF manual.

== $ - Demo mode ==

This allows pre-built motions to be played by using the remote control
esc or red button to exit back to command mode

== R - trace mode ==

Lets assume we have a small program
{{{
: l
List Program 
10 STAND 
20 WAIT KEY
30 RUN 17
40 GOTO 20
: 
}}}

Now enter trace mode.  The command is displayed BEFORE execution. Press any key to execute line or  Esc to go back to command mode.
{{{
: R
Run Program 
TRACE :: 10 - STAND ** User Break

}}}

== Q command ==

{{{
: Q
16 servos connected
4 lines stored
Uptime: 00:03:11-604
117, 85, 242, 39, 99, 126, 163, 3, 207, 146, 52, 54, 48, 200, 205, 205
: 
}}}

== X charge mode ==

Enter batter charging mode (also available by pressing PF1 at start up). It firsts test current voltage to determine if plugged in. i.e.

{{{
: X
testing charge
charge mode 
8550 mV
8664 mV
8664 mV
8721 mV
8721 mV
8721 mV
8721 mV
8721 mV
8664 mV
8664 mV
Not plugged in
: 
}}}

It will go on to charge (if plugged in) or return to command. Whilst charging any key will return to command mode.

== M - DCMP mode ==

This now enters Direct control mode (also available by pressing PF2 at start up). To exit DCMP requires power reset.

{{{
: M
DCMP MODE
}}}

== Dump memory ==
Really only for debugging

dump program eprom space (shows how Basic has encode program)
