#summary Linux Build of BASIC interpreter.

= Introduction =

The is a linux build of the Basic interpreter. At start up it will test on serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 for a connection to Robobuilder running DCMP. If it can connect it will display version. Any robot/RBC specific functions can then be carried using the remote link.

= Command line options =

  * DEBUG - verbose debug statement
  * LOAD  - this will auto-load bindata.txt
  * FAST  - this attempts to connect at 232400B to DCMP 
  * IR    - this switches on polling the IR status - this puts a load on the comms hence it optional - default is off
  * REMOTE - connect to robot running DCMP
  * COM     - COM port to connect to i.e. /dev/ttyA
  * COMPILE - put basic in input mode and read from stdio. Last line of input should be a '.'
  * RUN     - Load bindata.txt and run immediately

= BASIC differences =

Commands
  * Z - this will store the current program to local folder (bindata.txt)
  * z - this loads bindata.txt (rather than attempting file transfer)
  * m - load array ! with data from data.txt
  * M - store ! in to file data.txt

A range of ExtendedCommands - (commands that start with !) are also available.

Another clear difference is the speed! 4s for 2M operation, oe 2uS per instruction.
