#summary Linux Build of BASIC interpreter.

= Introduction =

The is a linux build of the Basic interpreter. At start up it will test on serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 for a connection to Robobuilder running DCMP. If it can connect it will display version. Any robot/RBC specific functions can then be carried using the remote link.

= Command line options =

  * DEBUG - verbose debug statement
  * LOAD  - this will auto-load bindata.txt
  * FAST  - this attempts to connect at 232400B to DCMP 
  * IR    - this switches on polling the IR status - this puts a load on the comms hence it optional - default is off

= BASIC differences =

Commands
  * Z - this will store the current program to local folder (bindata.txt)
  * z - this loads bindata.txt (rather than attempting file transfer)

= Example Session =

Another clear difference is the speed! 4s for 2M operation, oe 2uS per instruction.
