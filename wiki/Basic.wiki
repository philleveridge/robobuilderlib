= Introduction =

This custom firmware for Robobuilder gives it the ability to create and store simple programs in an elementary BASIC language. The software is stable beta release. *_Always download latest version firmware _*
  # For example programs see [SimpleDemos]and [BasicDemos]
  # Features - improved stability and expression handling. 
  # Event handling with ON TIME x GOSUB y and ON KEY GOSUB y (see example 22 - [SimpleDemos#22])
  # Operator precedence. i.e PRINT 3*5+4*6 now prints 39 (not 87!) 
  # AND, OR and MOD are supported i.e. PRINT (1=1) AND (2=2) prints 1 (true). The old | % & still work as well 
  # Complex expressions now work such as (from dynamic gate demo) 
    {{{ LET P=@B[Y]+@A[Y]*$SIN((X+@C[y])*16)/32768 }}}
  # Expression use 32 bit integer arithmetic - previously it was 16 bit, this make the range much better for complex expression - like above
  # There's a new variant of MOVE command MOVE A,B,C,D - see below
  # Adds improved list handling features. List are now separate from variable.
  # Reduce memory footprint - better stability
  # Versions for Linux and Windows now has floating point. 

= Getting started =
Download latest firmware (.HEX) and upload on to the RBC module using the [http://robobuilderlib.googlecode.com/files/rbctool.jpg RBCUpgrade] tool as per Robobuilder [http://robosavvy.com/RoboSavvyPages/Robobuilder/UsersManual/Robobuilder_User_Guide_EN.pdf manual pg 70].

If you're not using Windows, you can still download the custom firmware into your bot using the [ http://www.strout.net/info/robotics/utilities/avrbl-downloader/AVRBL Downloader tool]. Or there's a Java based tool available in the source tree.

If you want just to try it out (and not load on to Robot) then there are  windows and Linux OS builds is available  (basic.exe). It input/outputs using console. Some Robot hardware functions are available if the robot is running DCMP firmware connected om serial port.

So assuming you have downloaded the program (and installed the firmware) - reset the power on the RBC and connect a [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html VT100 terminal emulator] on the serial port (i.e. COM1 at 115200). You should see the following:
{{{
Basic v=$Revision: 452 $
Commands: i r l c z q s V R F $

16 servos connected
0 lines in memory
:
}}}

At the prompt type one of the following
  * i - input a new program [. at start of line will exit input mode]
  * r - run current program [or press Red button on IR remote]
  * R - run in TRACE mode
  * l - list current program
  * c - clear memory
  * z - download (requires client - see below)
  * q - check servos connected
  * V - print version / build
  * s - stand
  * $ - enter demo mode
  * X - enter battery charge mode
  * g - Go to specific line number

For more details and programming guide see the PDF manual.

The start mode is command mode signified by ':'. On pressing I it enters input mode and  you get a '>' prompt, In input mode any valid program code with a line number is stored in flash - and will be there after you turn the robot off. With no line number the command will be immediately executed. 

== Example session ==

{{{

1 lines entered, [28/3072] Bytes
: l

10 PRINT "hello"
20 GOTO 10
: c

: l
List Program
}}}

If the program ever gets into a recurring loop (either accidentally or deliberately) then press 'Esc' on the PC keyboard. If that fails then hit the 'OFF' button (on the robot!)

Notice how each time you enter input mode its adds to the current program. If you want to start over then press 'c.  To run the program press 'r' (and then Esc!)
